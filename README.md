# Password Generator

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a random password generator that will create and output a password based on the parameters that we input on the website.

## Installation

Open the link in a browser.

## Usage

Click the "Generate Password" button to begin the process. You will be prompted to enter a password length between 8 and 128 characters. Once you have selected a number in that range you will be prompted to confirm which kinds of characters you would like added to the password. Once you have confirmed them the password will feed out into the text box.
